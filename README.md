# Fate2Vec
Analyzing clonal behavior and identifying clone fate bias is a fundamental process in lineage tracing data analysis. Currently, many studies calculate clonal contribution percentages to define clone fate bias. However, such methods are not suitable for numerous application scenarios. For example, some types of lineage barcodes generated by CRISPR-Cas9 or Cre-LoxP systems result in varying lengths of genetic barcodes, leading to PCR bias, which significantly affects clonal contribution percentages.

Therefore, we have developed Fate2Vec, a word2vec and Simpson diversity index based machine learning framework that generates latent space representations for lineage tracing data and identifies clone fate bias. Fate2Vec provides: 

(1) clonal latent space representations, which can be utilized for downstream analyses; 

(2) Clone fate bias identification (fate clusters);

(3) Clonal trees construction;

(4) integrative analysis of lineage barcodes and other modalities (scRNA or scATAC).
